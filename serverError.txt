Line 5 - app.use is an Express function, which 
accepts the default Express arrow function to be used with errors.
Line 6 - builds the navigation bar for the error view.

Line 7 - a console statement to show the route and 
error that occurred. This is helpful to you to know what 
the client was doing when the error occurred.

Line 8 - calls the "error.ejs" view (you will build that next) 
in an "errors" folder.

Line 9 - sets the value of the "title" for the view. It will 
use the status code or "Server Error" as the title if no status 
code is set.

Line 10 - sets the message to be displayed in the error view 
to the message sent in the error object. We will alter this later.
